		\begin{cvsubsection}{Machine Learning Engineer}{Lyft Level 5, Self-Driving Division, Munich}{Aug 2018 -- Present}   
			\textit{ } \\
			\textbf{Technologies Used}: Python, C++, PyTorch, OpenCV \\
			\textbf{Semantic Map Generator}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Primary contributor and owner of the component that generates the HD semantic map required for on car perception, prediction and planning.
				\item Implemented geo spatial algorithms and ML pipelines to speed up the map creation with human annotators in the loop.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\textbf{Traffic Light Placement}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented a 3D placement algorithm for detecting and localizing traffic lights in point clouds.
				\item Integrated the automatic traffic light placement pipeline with Semantic Map Generator and QC tools for validation/correction 
				by human curators. This pipeline enabled the addition of traffic light elements in HD maps.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\textbf{Road Map Element Detection}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Implemented an annotation pipeline for creating ground truth datasets to extract geometries for different types of road elements (lanes, crosswalks, arrows, shark yields etc.).
				\item Led the implementation of semantic segmentation model training and shape extraction pipeline on the top down views created from projected camera images. 
				\item Mentored an intern to integrate different road element models in QC tools that resulted in 25\% reduction in QC time.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\textbf{LiDAR Point Cloud Annotation}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Designed and implemented a 3D detector (PointRCNN) and tracker (Kalman filter-based) pipeline to pre-populate object tracks to speed up the annotation of dynamic agents (cars, pedestrians, etc.) in LiDAR point clouds.
				\item Worked closely with the teams in Palo Alto to integrate the tracker pipeline in the UI tool for point cloud annotation.
			\end{itemize}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Machine Learning Engineer (Part-time)}{Terraloupe Gmbh}{Aug 2016 - April 2017}
		\textbf{ } \\
			\textbf{Technologies Used}: Python, Keras, OpenCV
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Experimented with various deep convolutional network architectures (PSPNet, UNet etc.) for semantic segmentation of roof objects attributes (solar panel, chimney etc.) from aerial images.
				\item Implemented geo spatial algorithms that used segmentation output and point clouds to deliver the available roof area for installing solar panels across different German cities.
			\end{itemize}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{Amazon, India}{Oct 2014 -- Oct 2015}  
			\textbf{Technologies Used}: Java, RDS, DynamoDB, Herd (Workflow-orchestration Engine)
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Optimized the seller data ingestion pipeline by detecting duplicate offers in daily XML feed.
				\item Built a system that automatically sends notifications (SMS, email) to sellers for older offers on junglee.com and implemented the deletion
				workflow that could be triggered via one-click or a missed call.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{Drishti Soft Solutions, India}{June 2012 -- Oct 2014}
			\textbf{Technologies Used}: Java, JAX-RS, PostgreSQL
			\begin{itemize} 
				\item Led the design and implementation of REST API for the core call center functionality (queuing calls, allocating agents etc.). Worked closely with CRM providers for integrating the API.
				\item Implemented a real-time monitoring system for analyzing the call volume and SLA in a call center. 
			\end{itemize}
