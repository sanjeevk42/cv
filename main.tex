    Multiple Action Prediction in Deep Reinforcement Learning (Python, Tensorflow, OpenAI Gym) \cite{anonymous2018predicting}
        \begin{itemize}
	        \item Proposed a new formulation for policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms in continuous action space problems.
	        \item The method predicts multiple action values at each state which facilitates better exploration during training and the agent converges to a better policy.
	        \item Evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed formulation against other continuous control algorithms (A3C, DDPG) on various Mujoco environments.

	Cell Detection in Lens-free Microscopy Videos (Python, Keras) \cite{rempfler-2017}
    	\begin{itemize}
    	\item This aim of the project was to detect and localize cells in lens free microscopy image sequences using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN).
        \item In this we experimented with different deep CNN architectures (FCN, UNet, DetectNet) and achieved best detection score of 95\% (F1) with fully convolutional ResNet-50.
